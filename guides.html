        <h1>WHAT IS DRONE?</h1>
        <br>
        <P>A "drone" is an unmanned aerial vehicle. 
            That is a machine that can fly without a 
            human pilot. Its flight path is programmed 
            by software or controlled by remote.<br>
            In 1935 the British produced a number of radio-controlled
             aircraft to be used as targets for training purposes. 
             It's thought the term 'drone' started to be used at this time,
              inspired by the name of one of these models, the DH. 82B Queen Bee.</P>
              <h4>This is just a general definition, there are different terms to refer
                 to this type of aircraft.</h4>
                 <p>
                    <li>RPA or RPAS refers to Remotely Piloted Aircraft and Remotely Piloted 
                        Aircraft Systems. This concept refers to the remote control of an aircraft.</li>
                    <li>Drone, the most popular name, refers to unmanned aircraft.</li>
                    <li>UAV or UAS is an acronym for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Unmanned Aerial System.
                         This concept refers to the absence of a physical pilot on the aircraft.</li>

    <h3>Multi-Rotor drones</h3>
    <p>Multi-rotor drones, also known as rotary-wing, are the most widely 
        used type of drones for recreational and professional use. 
        Their small size and excellent control make multi-rotor drones
         the best choice for aerial photography.</p>
         <div class="container1"> 

         </div>
         <p><h5>"Multirotor drone is a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that has more than one 
            motor that powers the propellers to take flight and maneuver the aircraft."</h5></p>
            <br>
         <p>Offering great versatility, they allow the installation of 
            all types of cameras to perform different tasks. They are drones
             that can hover easily and take off vertically, adding more flexibility as well.</p>
             
             <p>However, the biggest drawback of multi-rotor drones is usually related to the 
                flight autonomy they offer. Adding more rotors makes the drone more difficult to control.
                 All those moving parts also consume extra energy, draining the battery faster.
                  Most multi-rotor drones have a flight time of less than an hour. If we want to 
                  perform certain tasks that take a long time, we have to have several batteries 
                  to replace them. This also means extra costs.</p>
                  
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="about-col7">
    <h3>Fixed-Wing Hybrid VTOL drones</h3>
    <p>As the latest drone technology to be introduced, fixed-wing hybrid VTOL drones refer to fixed-wing
         aircraft that have been modified to take off and land vertically. They combine the long-range and
          flight time of fixed-wing UAVs with the vertical takeoff capability of rotary-wing devices,
           eliminating the drawbacks of fixed-wing UAVs that require large spaces for takeoff and landing. 
           They are designed for mapping, power line inspection, surveillance, agriculture, and rescue
            operations.</p>
          <div class="container2"> 
            
          </div>
          <p><h5>"Fixed wing hybrid drones are a relatively new type of drone that combines the benefits of 
            fixed wing and multi-rotor drones."</h5></p>
          <p>However, this VTOL drone tends to be unsuitable for beginners, and the more advanced technology 
            puts it at the high end of the fixed-wing drone market in terms of cost.</p>
</div>

<div class="about-col8">
    <h3>Single-Rotor Helicopter drones</h3>
    <p>Powerful and durable, single-rotor drones look similar in construction and design to actual helicopters,
         with only one rotor to provide power, plus a tail to control direction and stability. Combining the 
         advantages of tiny multi-rotor drones and single-rotor drones, they are better suited to carry larger 
         payloads and fly more efficiently than multi-rotors. Single-rotor devices typically use gas engines 
         rather than batteries, which greatly increases their flight time.</p>
          <div class="container3"> 
            
          </div>
          <p><h5>"Single-rotor drone types are strong and durable. They look similar to actual helicopters in
             structure and design. A single-rotor has just one rotor, which is like one big spinning wing, plus
              a tail rotor to control direction and stability."</h5></p>
          <p>However, these drones tend to be larger and more complex than other types of UAVs. This means they 
            are more expensive and more difficult to operate, and their larger blades can make them more dangerous.</p>
</div>

<div class="about-col9">
    <h3>Fixed-Wing drones</h3>
    <p>Fixed-wing drones are those capable of harnessing air and generating forces that allow them to stay in the 
        air by taking advantage of their aerodynamics. They are similar in design or aesthetics to radio-controlled
         aircraft and are often used to map large areas due to their powerful autonomy. They take advantage of 
         their aerodynamics and design to keep them afloat, which means they have a longer endurance and flight 
         speed.</p>
          <div class="container4"> 
            
          </div>
          <p><h5>" A fixed-wing drone has one rigid wing that is designed to look and work like an aeroplane,
             providing the lift rather than vertical lift rotors."</h5></p>
          <p>The downside of fixed-wing drones is that they tend to be more expensive compared to multi-rotor 
            drones. They require a large, clear space to take off and land, just like airplanes. Some larger 
            models also require specialized ground equipment to help them take off and land. In addition, 
            fixed-wing drones can only fly forward, so they do not offer the same maneuverability as 
            multi-rotor drones.</p>

                    <p>Competitive drone or FPV racing is generally used on private and strictly regulated land and consists of obstacle courses at high speeds by flying a drone with virtual reality glasses, an activity that requires many hours of training to gain the agility and reflexes needed to control the drone. There are now a growing number of clubs that 
                        can legally engage in this hobby.</p>

                        needs of the customer.</p>
                    <p>Professional drones are the only aircraft that can fly over built-up areas, restricted or prohibited areas, and conduct night flights, as long as the professional pilot has made a county declaration and obtained the required

                                Better speed and torque due to the absence of brushes, because brush friction increases with speed,

                        <h3>Brushed drone motors</h3>
                        <p>Brushed motors are the type of motor present in most recreational drones. While they are indeed cheaper motors, they also require more maintenance 
                            than brushless motors.</p>
                        <P>The power of these motors is practically the same in all the models we could find, only the size varies (the larger the size, the more power). However, most of these motors are not in direct contact 
                                with the propeller.</P>
                        <P>The motor is connected to a pinion gear which turns a large gear which in turn drives the motor. This is called a "speed reducer" because due to these two gears we are reducing the maximum power the engine can give us. This will help us operate the drone and will extend its life because we will not be pushing the motor to its limits 
                                    at any given time.</P>

                        <h3>Brushless drone motors</h3>
                        <p>The main feature of these motors is the absence of brushes in contact with the rotor. This keeps its maintenance to a minimum and its operation very effective and efficient. In addition, these motors have much higher power than brush/brushless motors (50-70 km/h compared to 150-200 km/h 
                            for brushless motors).</p>
                        <P>However, these types of drone motors work mainly with alternating current, therefore, each motor must have its own ESC. ESC (electronic speed controller) or electronic variables that can define the speed of rotation 
                            of the brushless motor.</P>
